- 👋 Hi, I’m @Andrerj, 31 years old, I got my degree in Web Systems at Centro Universitário Senac where, too, I worked on iOS apps at Apple Developer Academy(BEPiD). Currently, I'm located at São Bernardo do Campo, São Paulo, Brazil.
 
- 👀 I’m interested mainly in mobile and web development and opportunities for a position as mobile developer.

- 🌱 I’m currently relearning iOS(Swift) by myself, enrolled in Bootcamp: Geração Tech Unimed-BH - Ciência de dados at DIO and using github as a place to store studies, challenges and projects.
