- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Andrerj, 32 years old, I got my degree in Web Systems at Centro UniversitÃ¡rio Senac where, too, I worked on iOS apps at Apple Developer Academy(BEPiD). Currently, I'm located at SÃ£o Bernardo do Campo, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.
 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested mainly in mobile and web development and opportunities for a position as mobile developer.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently relearning iOS(Swift) by myself and using github as a place to store studies, challenges and projects.
